## Kubernetes
### Infos
- `Node`
  - Also refered to as `Worker Nodes`
  - Physical/virtual server instance (e.g. AWS EC2 instance), which runs 0 - N `pods`
  - Receives commands / pod specs (.yml or .json files) and is monitored via the `Kubelet` (process running on every node)
- `Pod`
  - 1 - N Containers sharing the same excecution enviorment, which allows inter-process communication
  - Has a unique IP address in the cluster
  - Pods shouldn't be run without a `ReplicaSet` or `Deployment` (described later)
- `Master node` aka `API Server`
  - The node to interact with the cluster (starting, stopping, monitoring the nodes/pods)
- `Config Map`
  - Used to configure Pods
- `Service`
  - Defines a set of pods and how to access them (discovering & exposing of pods)
  - Acts as the entry point to a set of pods
  - When discovering services (e.g. from another service) two ways are supported: `Environment variables` and `DNS` [More Infos](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services)
  - Types:
    - `ClusterIP`: exposed just inside the clusters
    - `NodePort`: exposed to the outside via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`
    - `LoadBalancer`: Exposes the service externally using a cloud providerâ€™s load balancer via `<ClusterIP>:<Port>`
    - `ExternalName`: Maps the service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com)
  - Canary release
    - It's possible to spin up pods with the same name, but the new container (v1 -> v2). The service will pick up the new instances.
    - Another way would be to use an ingress controller like: [Zalando Ingress Contrller](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller)
- `ReplicaSet`
  - Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time
  - It's recommanded to use `Deployments` to manage those
- `Job`
  - Creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully complete
  - Well suited for tasks that need to run only once (complementary to `ReplicaSet`)
- `Deployment`
  - Higher-level concept to manage `Pods` and `ReplicaSets`
  - Different strategies to replace pods with new versions: `Recreate` or `RollingUpdate`
  - Continuous delivery is not covered by default, instead the image (tag) has to be changed for every deploy [More Infos](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/)
- `DaemonSet`
  - Similar to Deployments (create Pods which are not expected to terminate)
  - Use when it is important that a Pod always runs on certain hosts, and when it needs to start before other Pods
  - `Deployment` for stateless services where it's not important which host the Pod runs on
- `StatefulSets`
  - Like a deployment, but each pod has it's unique identiy (network, storage etc.), that will be kept across rescheduling
  - It's also possible to define the order pods are started/exchanged and make sure pods are always unique
- `Namespace`
  - Provides: unique naming scope, constraints for resource consumption, authentication
  - When no namespace is set, the `default` namespace is used
- `ResourceQuota`
  - Can be assigned to namespaces, to restrict how much of cluster resources can be consumed across all resources in a namespace
  - Can include things like: `cpu`, `memory`, `pods`, `services`, ...
- `NetworkPolicy`
  - Specify how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints
  - Needs a `NetworkController` like: [Calico](https://www.projectcalico.org/) or [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kubernetes/kube-addon/)
  - By default (without a policy) all incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic from/to pods is allowed
  - Examples: [deny-everything](kubernetes/network-policy-deny.yml) and [other-options](kubernetes/network-policy.yml)
- `Ingress`
  - 
- `Charts`
  - Collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources (e.g. one pod like memcached or a whole app stack like wordpress etc.)
  - The files need to ne laid out in a particular directory tree and include files like a [Chart.yml](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#the-chartyaml-file) or [requirements.yml](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#managing-dependencies-with-requirementsyaml)
- `Helm`
  - Tool to manage Kubernetes `Charts`, similar to a package manager like `apt` or `npm`
  
### SetUp
- Running a kubernetes cluster on your local machine
  - [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases)
  - OSX: `brew cast install minikube`
  - Provides only one `Node`
- CLI/Client to make requests to the Kubernetes API server / master node
  - [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
  - OSX: `brew install kubectl`

### Commands
#### Minikube
  - Start the cluster: `minikube start`
  - Get the cluster ip address: `minikube ip`
  - Get the cluster status: `minikube status`
  - Open a service running minikube in the browser: `minikube service <service-name>`
  - Stop the cluster: `minikube stop`

#### Kubectl
  - Run a container with a given name as/in a pod (deployment): `kubectl run <name> --image=<imagename> --labels="<labels>" --port=<port>`
  - Running a spec file: `kubectl apply/create -f <filename>.yaml`
  - Get the logs of a running pod: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
  - Open a shell in your pod: `kubectl exec <name>delet -it /bin/bash`
  - Get a list of running pods/deployments/services/...: `kubectl get <pods/deployments/services/nodes/...>`
  - Get pods/deployments/services/... infos: `kubectl describe <pod/deployment/service/noide/...> <name>`
  - Delete a pods/deployments/services/...: `kubectl delete <pod/deployment/service/...> <name>`
  - Apply a ConfigMap to the nodes in the cluster: `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`
  - Merge two kubectl-config files: `KUBECONFIG=<path/file1>:<path/file2> kubectl config view --flatten > <outputfile>`
  - List and switch between clusters/contexts: `kubectl config get-contexts`, `kubectl config current-context`, `kubectl config use-context`
  - Mark node as not usable (no new pods will be scheduled): `kubectl drain <node>`

##### Kubectl - Proxy
  - It's possible to start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server: `kubectl proxy --port=<local-port>`
  - Afterwards it's possible to explore the API suing http requests like:
    - `curl http://localhost:8080/api/`
    - `curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods`
  - It also allows to expose a "public" endpoint to a service running in the cluster

##### Access pods/app
  - Forward a port: `kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<app-pod-port>`
  - OR write a service spec file and run it: `kubectl create -f <service-spec>`
  - BUT when running on minikube, no `EXTERNAL-IP` will be available, solution: `minikube service <service-name>` will open the browser with the exposed service
  - Also possible to use just the cli
    1. Expose a pod as a service: `kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --port=<to-the-outside> --target-port=<container-port> --name=<service-name>`
    2. Start a Proxy: `kubectl proxy --address 0.0.0.0 --accept-hosts '.*' --port <service-port>`
    3. Should be visible under: https://ENVIRONMENT_ID.vfs.cloud9.REGION_ID.amazonaws.com/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/services/SERVICE-NAME/

##### Rollouts
  - Record depolyments for later rollback: `kubectl create/apply -f ... --record`
  - Take a look at the last deplyments/roll-outs: `kubectl rollout history deployment <name>`
  - Roll-back: `kubectl rollout undo deployment <name> --to-revision=<revision-number>`

##### Dealing with credentials / private docker images
  - Creating a docker-hub secret to access private images: `kubectl create secret docker-registry <name-for-secret> --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pword> --docker-email=<your-email>`
  - List secrets: `kubectl get secret`
  - Delete a secret: `kubectl delete secret <name>`

##### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
  - Create an autoscaler: `kubectl autoscale deployment webapp --cpu-percent=80 --min=1 --max=10`
    - tries to maintain average CPU utilization of 80%, with a max of 10 pods running
  - Get the Autoscaler state: `kubectl get hpa`
  - Simple methode to run a load test: `kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh`
    - On the bash run: `while true; do wget -q -O- <service-url>; done`

#### Helm
  - Install a chart: `helm install <chart-name>`
  - Take a look at the manifests before installing: `helm install --dry-run --debug <chart-name>`
  - List or delete depolyed charts: `helm list` and `helm delete`
  - Find issues with your own chart: `helm lint <chart-name>`
  - Package and share your own chart: `helm package` and `helm serve`
